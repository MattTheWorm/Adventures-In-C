# Adventures In C
My adventures in learning good ol' C. The old (but kinda unstable) uncle everyone loves to hang out with.  
~~Pretty fun language.~~ Good language to learn to understand how software and hardware interact.  
UPDATE (10/20/22) Don't know what I was thinking saying C was "fun" 🤦‍♂️.
