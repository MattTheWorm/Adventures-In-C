# Classwork
Class assignments ranging from highly basic homework programs up to more complex exam programs.

**Exams**

Yeah, the big boys. At least for now they seem that way. Probably going to look back on them in the future in shame. 

**Homework**

Usually something incredibly small, sometimes a teensy bit more complex. Just fun little programs to make for retention and practice (I don't know if that's the same thing really. Though I guess not since you practice to gain retention as well???).

**Bonus**

Usually extra credit. Typically the hardest programs to test the limits of a student's knowledge if they're ahead in the class. AKA THE MOST FUN!!!
